# Small_Simple_Programs
Relatively small, simple programs that I have written (in Java or Python) for school or in my own time either for fun.
While none of these programs are impressive in themselves, they do show how I have used computer programming to solve a variety of small problems.

Some of the Java programs here may require stdlib.jar (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/) to work.
