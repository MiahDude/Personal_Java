# Small_Simple_Programs
Relatively small, simple programs that I have written for school or in my own time for fun.
While none of these programs are impressive in themselves, they do show how I have used different programming languages to solve a variety of small problems.

Some of the Java programs here may require stdlib.jar (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/) to work.
