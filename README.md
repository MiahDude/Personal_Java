# Small_Simple_Programs
Relatively small, simple programs that I have written between January 2018 and the present for school or in my own time for fun. 
While none of these programs are impressive in themselves, they do show how I have used different programming languages to solve a variety of small problems.

Java programs in SimpleGraphics require stdlib.jar (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/).
