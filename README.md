# Programming_Portfolio
A variety of programs that I have written between January 2018 and the present for school or in my own time. 
While most of these programs may not be impressive in themselves, they do show how I have learned the fundamentals in a variety programming languages.

Java programs in SimpleGraphics require stdlib.jar (https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/).
