# Benford's Law
A series of programs I created to empirically study Benford's Law for an information literacy project.
Also included are some text files that I used to test Benford.java, most of which I generated myself with the included programs. Population.txt uses population data that I pulled from some online source, but unfortunately I only wrote down that source in the paper I wrote for that project which I have now lost. It was so long ago (Fall 2018) that I no longer remember what that source was, though I think it may have come from a Wikipedia page somewhere if I remember correctly.
